TechAcademy seeks to shape the digital leader and thus drive and contribute to the digital transformation. So far, we have introduced participants to digital tools through our coding tracks, making it easier for them to develop a better understanding of technology. Although coding skills are important, a digital leader also needs to have the necessary skills to generate and enforce new ideas. With the project management track we want to strengthen your innovative spirit and the required soft skills. In this track you will be introduced to the basics of project management using the design thinking framework to generate and test customer-centric ideas. Based on this idea you will develop an initial prototype with figma, which you will pitch at the end of the semester. Our mix of select online courses and a real-world semester project allows you to experience the phases of an IT project first-hand. We will help and guide you along the way to the best of our abilities! Over the next months, there will be a total of five Coding Meetups, spaced out evenly where you will have the ability to meet your peers, work together on your project and receive help from your mentor. In preparation we partnered up with Udemy and thus you have free access to the Design Thinking and Figma course. Everything you will learn there, you can later use within your own project and solidify your knowledge. We will go over the course and establish a timeframe on how far you should have progressed before each meetup later on. In your project, you can work in groups of up to four team members. You can choose your teammates independently and we will not interfere with your arrangements. It is however beneficial to collaborate with students from different university faculties as this allows you to gain new perspectives on the project and tasks. We are very excited to have you here and looking forward to this exciting semester with you!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#it-project-management","text":"","title":"IT Project-Management"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"TechAcademy seeks to shape the digital leader and thus drive and contribute to the digital transformation.

This will be your chance to get to know the fellow participants and form your group. Sprint 0 Watch the following sections: Introduction Learn The Kinds Of Problems To Solve With Design Thinking -Design Thinking Process Design Thinking Stage 1 - Empathy Empathy, Empathy, Empathy!! 4.2 IT Project-Management Introduction (09.11.2022) In this session you will gain first insights into the project and the design thinking framework. During the Intro Workshop, the Project Management Track starts with the first phase: Empathize. The goal is to create an understanding for the problems and challenges regarding the topic area. Connections are to be uncovered and understood, and stakeholders and their needs are to be identified. To understand the needs of your user group, you will interview fellow peers. During the session, we will discuss what aspects to pay attention to and you will have time to design the questionnaire. Here you can find tips on how to phrase your questions. I would suggest that you create your questionnaire using Google Forms as google will automatically visualize your quantitative results. If you\u2019d like to conduct in person interviews, this can help you. Sprint 1 Interview your peers (don't forget to document the answers!) Analyze your interviews Watch the following sections: Design Thinking Stage 2 - Define Learn User Journey Maps Learn Point of View & The \u201cHow Might We\u201d Method For Discovering Pain Points -Design Thinking Stage 3 - Ideation Amazing Brainstorming For Ideas! Learn About Selecting Solutions In Design Thinking 4.3 First MeetUp (23.11.2022) After analyzing the results of your interviews, you will define the main pain points of your target group. You can document these findings by creating \u2018How Might We\u2019- Statements . Remember your statements should focus on the users' needs and be phrased as an opportunity, not a solution. For example we as TechAcademy could ask ourselves: How might we motivate our participants to finish the semester program when unmotivated? Of course you can also use other techniques, for example creating personas, which has been mentioned in the Udemy course. Based on your core findings and the pain points of your target group, we move on to the ideation phase and start brainstorming. Here you should generate as many ideas as possible. In this phase quantity over quality applies. Feasibility and restrictions are disregarded for the time being. This is also called divergent thinking. After you have collected your ideas, you have to choose the best one. Which idea is feasible, which is realistic? Maybe you can combine some ideas? It is important that you document the decision process and explain why you have chosen your model as a press release. How this is supposed to look like and which questions should be answered you can find here: https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase2-define/future-press-release Sprint 2 Finalize your idea (What should the app look like, what features does it contain?) Take a look at the Figma section of this guideline. Create your Figma Account and get a feel for the use of it. Watch the following sections: Desing Thinking Stage 4 - Prototyping 4.4 Second MeetUp (14.12.2022) In this meetup you will start creating your prototype. To make sure you have all main features included and know what the user experience is supposed to be like you can create a storyboard. In the storyboard you\u2019ll map out the user's journey while using the app. More information here: https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase5-prototype/storyboard Your story board could look like this: It could also look like this: You can find more examples here. You can also use any other method you\u2019ve gotten to know in the Udemy Course. Sprint 3 Watch the following sections: Design Thinking Stage 5 - Testing Looking Ahead To a Successful Implementation Following Design Thinking 4.5 Third MeetUp (11.01.2023) In this meetup you will have time to continue working on your prototype in your groups. Additionally we will talk about your pitches. What does a good pitch entail and how do you structure it? Sprint 4 Finish your prototype Test your prototype on potential users, gather feedback and adjust your prototype if necessary Prepare your pitch 4.6 Fourth MeetUp (01.02.2023) Today is your big day! You will present your idea in front of the group and get some feedback. Sprint 5 Create the documentation of your approach in each phase and the key findings of each phase (max. 5 pages) Submit the documentation and the link to your prototype Deadline: Hand-In on 04.02.2023 (11.59PM) Passing Criteria To pass this course and get your certificate your group will have to: Go through and hand in a documentation of the key findings of each phase Create and hand in the prototype of your idea Pitch your idea (01.02.22) Your documentation and the prototype have to be submitted to our email address ( projekt@tech-academy.io) before the deadline (04.02.2023).

These can also be performed several times. In the Emphasize phase, the needs of the target group must be identified. This is done by interviewing and observing the users. The goal is to capture the target group and its needs. In the Define phase, all observations are collected and initial patterns are identified. The goal is to answer which user needs exist and which problems need to be solved. The core element of Design Thinking is the Ideate Phase. In this phase, as many ideas as possible should be generated according to the motto: \"Quantity before quality\". Finally, the ideas are summarized and evaluated. The best ideas make it to the Prototype Phase. The goal is to make the ideas tangible for the user. These are rough drafts. Once the prototype has been created, the most critical phase begins: Evaluate. The focus should be on the features that the user likes or dislikes and the respective argumentation.

I was surprised that the app did not meet any of my needs; It was very slow and didn't provide me with much information. I was expecting a fully functional app, which provided me with access to the most important resources for my studies. Instead, I have to access multiple different websites to check my grades, my university emails, access to my course materials and retrieve a lot of other relevant information. Navigating through that is not only tedious but also confusing. Websites, even when well built, do not offer the instant, on-the-go functionality that mobile apps do. According to statistics, 80% of millennials have their smartphones with them, basically 24/7. In modern society, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches have become essential devices and students in many cases come to university only carrying a smartphone and a tablet. For this reason, a user-friendly campus app would contribute to enhancing the student\u2019s academic experience. When students have all the information they need at their fingertips and can perform many tasks from one mobile app, they are more likely to register for their courses in time and navigate more efficiently through their academic journey in general. They can more easily connect with their professors and peers when they have a single app that centralizes information and functions. In essence, they are more engaged.

Well, sort of \u201cto life\u201d because you will not program a whole application. The beauty of prototyping is that you only need a realistic facade. This makes it a fast process, allowing you to quickly implement new features and test your concept with potential clients and stakeholders. Why must it look realistic, you might ask. The general idea is that people will give you honest feedback and react honestly to your product. If they see it is just a sketch, they will answer more leniently and might hesitate with feedback (Knapp et al. 2016). Honest feedback helps you in turn to figure out whether you\u2019re on the right track with your current iteration of the product or not. Also, it won\u2019t hurt much to change a prototype, which only took you a couple of hours to create, making it easier to accept criticism (Knapp et al., 2016). How do you approach Prototyping? Jake Knapp, the inventor of Design Sprints, has four principles for prototyping, which we\u2019ll focus on in this course as well: You can build anything Prototypes are disposable Build only essential features The Prototype must look real We won\u2019t go much into detail about these principles, because we believe them to be quite self-explanatory. But we do want to give you a few hints on how to start your prototyping journey! Before you start prototyping, don\u2019t jump right into it, but first, write down your key features and sketch them. The best thing to do is to create a storyboard for your app, where you lay out the most important screens of your app. Then you think about a progression, a user might do, when navigating your app. This storyboard will function as a guideline later, when actually prototyping. Feel free to take a look at Google\u2019s Design Sprint Toolkit to get a better idea of a storyboard. Now on to the actual prototyping. There are different ways to create a prototype of your product, as you know from Section 4 of the Udemy Course. Since we are working on a Student App, we\u2019ll focus on creating a click-through-dummy prototype. One of the best tools for click-through dummies is called Figma . It allows you to design and create complex User Interfaces for different screen sizes. It has many features, as you can see from their documentation . Please take a look at it, it\u2019s worth it! What is nice about Figma: It is free to use - all you need is a free account. We won\u2019t talk you through creating a prototype, because it\u2019s a pain to write down and a pain for you to read. It\u2019s easier to watch this YouTube Tutorial to get a feeling for Figma. Optionally, you can take a look at the Figma YouTube Channel , which also has interesting tutorials. While Figma has lots of features and you can design virtually anything from scratch, you don\u2019t have to. If you\u2019re not a designer you can have a look at Figma\u2019s community . There you can find designs from other Figma users, which you can easily include in your own designs. You can find Phone Mockups , UI Kits , or even Student Planner App Mockups . Feel free to look around there and see what suits your idea best. Once you have your designs ready, all there is left to do is create the interactions. For that, you can use Figma\u2019s prototype tab on the right-hand side. Here\u2019s a quick video on how to add interactions to your prototype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg When you\u2019re done with prototyping it\u2019s time to make a test run and see how your app feels and if all important features are \u201cworking\u201d.","title":"Prototyping"},{"location":"prototyping/#prototyping","text":"Prototyping is the fun part, where you can bring your previous ideas to life.
