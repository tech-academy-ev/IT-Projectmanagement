# Project

I remember downloading the campus app at the beginning of my studies, expecting to get the most important information for my studies. I was surprised that the app did not meet any of my needs; It was very slow and didn't provide me with much information. I was expecting a fully functional app, which provided me with access to the most important resources for my studies. Instead, I have to access multiple different websites to check my grades, my university emails, access to my course materials and retrieve a lot of other relevant information. Navigating through that is not only tedious but also confusing. 
Websites, even when well built, do not offer the instant, on-the-go functionality that mobile apps do.

According to statistics, 80% of millennials have their smartphones with them, basically 24/7. In modern society, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches have become essential devices and students in many cases come to university only carrying a smartphone and a tablet. For this reason, a user-friendly campus app would contribute to enhancing the studentâ€™s academic experience. 
When students have all the information they need at their fingertips and can perform many tasks from one mobile app, they are more likely to register for their courses in time and navigate more efficiently through their academic journey in general. They can more easily connect with their professors and peers when they have a single app that centralizes information and functions. In essence, they are more engaged. 

You will therefore find out this semester what makes a user-friendly campus app from the user's point of view, create a prototype for it and present your idea.
